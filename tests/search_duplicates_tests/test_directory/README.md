# hashesDB
## Description
hashesDB will be a command line tool that will help users manage a database of hashes of files. It will provide several database-related functionalities such as insertion, deletion and searching. It will also support fuzzy hashing, a hashing technique based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing that makes it possible to perform similarity checking with the use of hashing.

## My Progression
I regularly add logs that briefly describe the project's progression in [this](https://github.com/gkosm314/gsoc2021-hashesDB/wiki/Project-Journal) page.

## Documentation
You can find extensive user documentation [here](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2021-hashesDB/wiki/hashesdb-Documentation).

## Final presentation
I wrote a blog post in which I present what I worked on during the coding period of Google Summer of Code 2021. You can find it [here](https://github.com/eellak/gsoc2021-hashesDB/wiki/hashesdb-presentation).
